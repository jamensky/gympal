GYMPAL: YOUR CURE TO PROCRASTINATION

Anyone who knows me will know that gym is life for me. One of the list obvious reason as to why I love staying fit, its because exercising has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to keep our IQ level from deteriorating. In particular, heavy lifting, of all exercises appears to be the most effective in achieving this. What's this to do with a rails application you may ask; well, if you are like me, you love to procrastinate and are stay swayed back into that deadly comfort zone. My personal reason for my procrastination is not seeing results after periods of hard work, due to a lack of effective training, based on an incremental strategy. GymPal has been designed with this challenge in mind. GymPal is a workout management system which all my fellow procrastinators can rely on when loosing track and drifting away from the path of righteousness.
